OSINT Challenge: "Where am I?" – 300 Points
One of the most frustrating and challenging exercises I’ve ever taken on… but also the most rewarding!

🌟 The Journey Begins
I saw the challenge and—bam!—my mind flashed back to the prelims with the GitHub thing. I was instantly in detective mode.

What followed? Twelve straight hours of relentless Googling. I used every trick in the book:

Google dorking
Scouring social media
Hunting for hidden clues
Deep dives into YouTube, GitHub, and even physical searches!
🚦 First Hints: Roadblocks
Sadly, the initial hints led nowhere. Frustration set in. But then, the next batch of hints dropped—and that's when things clicked!

🔑 The Breakthrough
The word “gencysstrategy” stood out. I dorked it:
site:* intext:"gencysstrategy"

Boom! An Instagram account: @Gencysstrategy.
Their bio? A string of emojis—mysterious, but promising:

😘😘😘😘 😍 😍 😘😍😍😘 😘😘😘 😍😍😍😘😘😘 ...and more.

Decoded it. Got a YouTube link:

⏳ The Waiting Game
There was a technical hiccup—the CTF team had to fix something—so I waited.
But heartbreak: they released the YouTube link as a public hint!
My 12 hours of hard work felt exposed—but I wasn't giving up.

🕵️‍♂️ Deep Dive: The YouTube Trail
Opened the video, checked the transcript—found: "z=5000"
Noticed the channel had a second video. Its captions held a fragment of another YouTube link.
That video’s description? Even more clues!
I realized: I needed to find latitude and longitude coordinates.

🖥️ The Web Sleuth
Back to the channel. The banner had a URL:
gencysosintwebpage.app

Inspected the webpage source—found a comment mentioning /assets/.

Navigated to:
gencysosintwebpage.app/assets/Flag.png

Downloaded the image. Ran exiftool—discovered an equation in the user comment.

🤖 Bringing It All Together
Tossed everything into ChatGPT. Out popped coordinates—pointing to the UST campus!

🗺️ The Last Puzzle Pieces
I spent two hours scouring the map. Out of curiosity, I browsed the newest reviews—
💥 Base64 string discovered!
Decoded it, found a new GitHub link with two repositories.

The "Access Denied" repo: full of serious stuff.
Got a fake flag—so close!
Down to my last flag submission attempt—tension rising!
🏁 The Final Stretch
Out of options, I checked the repository’s Actions tab. There it was: the precious flag!

With just one attempt left, I submitted it.
Victory! 300 points bagged!

🎉 The Aftermath
Twelve hours of pure detective work, wild goose chases, and a rollercoaster of emotions.
But in the end? Totally worth it.
