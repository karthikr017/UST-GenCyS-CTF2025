Where am I?- 300 points 


One of the most frustrating and challenging exercise I have taken in eternity

The first set of Hints were damn wrong and irrelevant

1.I saw the question and immediately my mind went to the prelims about the GitHub thing(it was also now)
2.Then I was literally spammming the google for 12 hours straight 
3.My search included Google dorking, searching in popular social medias and also hidden things!, doing physical search, searching in youtube, GitHub and everywhere
4.The next set of hints came and that's where things started to clickkkk!!! the word "gencysstrategy" got my mind and I dorked google 
5.site:* intext:"gencysstrategy" The ultimate prize a Instagram  account with username @Gencysstrategy 
6.Straight up I saw their bio and the explicitly that emojissss damnnn!!!

7.Easily decoded it and got https://youtu.be/vbz2qb_-lny
8.But the CTF team said there is a technical issue and took some time to resolve it
9.The next thing broke my heart, they released the link as hint!!! My 12hour Hardwork got laughed
10.i got the youtube link and saw the video, clicked the transcript and it showed "z=5000"
and I was blank
11.Then I noticed the channel has two videos  been uploaded 
12.The other one had a piece of youtube link in the captions
13.I got into the link, the youtube video's description spiced up
14.At that time I thought ALL I need to find is a latitude and Longitude Coordinates
15.Then as usual I clicked the channel for any other videos and I found a url in the banner ."gencysosintwebpage.app" 
16 Inspected the webpage and  found a comment mentioning /assets/
17.got a hidden directory gencysosintwebpage.app/assets/Flag.png
18.Downloaded the image and Immediately used exiftool and found some equation in the user comment
19.Mixed all of that in the chatgpt and it gave me the coordinates of UST campus 
20.That where things  started to slow down , I was there in the map for more than 2 hours 
21.I was accidently seeing the reviews and filtered to newest 
22.Boom found a base64 string and decoded it 
23.Got a GitHub link and it had two repos 
24."Access Denied" repo has some serious stuffs
25.i got a fake flag 
26.Before everything i was bruteforcing the flag and has left with single attempt damn!
27.I did everything except seeing the actions
28.Saw it and found the precious flag, but i was also scared what if it's wrong? and i only had single attempt
29.Gave a try and bagged 300 points 
30.The 12 hour of fantasy came to an end!!!
